save your job details and easily build a resume from them

## why?

well you know formatting in Word is just eeghh😵‍💫😵‍💫🥴, ya
and I hate the copy paste from my *plain* docx resume to online formatters, just to get paywalled😑
so I made this to easily get all your past job experiences and (marketable or not) skills

oh yeah, I also wanted to save how it was actually like not just the stuffy professionalism, but my experience with storms and how I really be carrying teams💪🏿

## but cli?

I love the terminal, bite me
plus it's just for now I'll try and make a server instance or sum l8r if I continue to remember and care 🙃

## I want to help

don't jk lol, sure

# resume-builder
save your job details and easily build a resume from them

## why?

well you know formatting in Word is just eeghh😵‍💫😵‍💫🥴, ya
and I hate the copy paste from my *plain* docx resume to online formatters, just to get paywalled😑
so I made this to easily get all your past job experiences and (marketable or not) skills

oh yeah, I also wanted to save how it was actually like not just the stuffy professionalism, but my experience with storms and how I really be carrying teams💪🏿

## but cli?

I love the terminal, bite me

## I want to help

please do

## todo ✔️
 - [ ] make a nice app for web or sumn
 - [ ] add output to txt, pdf, or docx
 - [ ] add hooks for theming output
